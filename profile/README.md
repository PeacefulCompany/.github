# Hello. there...
You are probably wondering what the hell this Organisation is. Well, quite frankly we don't know either. We have an interrobang as a logo to emphasise the fact we don't know what we are doing and to seal the deal, we have made it extremely clear that all our decisions, revolving engineering of any kind, are indeed questionable.

I hope you Enjoy our work :D...

or atleast try to

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
